# Test Techniques Overview

Test techniques support the tester in:
- test analysis (what to test) and 
- test design (how to test). 

Test techniques help to develop a relatively small, but sufficient, set of test cases in a systematic way. Test techniques help to define:
- test conditions, 
- identify coverage items, and 
- identify test data
during the test analysis and design. 

In this syllabus, test techniques are classified as 
- black-box, 
- white-box, and 
- experience-based

## Black-box test techniques 

(also known as **specification-based techniques**) are based on an analysis of
the specified behavior of the test object **without reference to its internal structure**. Therefore, the test cases are independent of how the software is implemented. Consequently, if the implementation changes, but the required behavior stays the same, then the test cases are still useful.
Commonly used specification-based techniques:
- Equivalence Partitioning
- Boundary Value Analysis
- Decision Table Testing
- State Transition Testing

### White-box test techniques 
(also known as structure-based techniques) are based on an analysis of the
test object’s internal structure and processing. 
- Only after the design or implementation of the test object.

### Experience-based test techniques 
effectively use the knowledge and experience of testers for the design and implementation of test cases. 
- The effectiveness of depends on the tester’s skills. 
- complementary to ther types
