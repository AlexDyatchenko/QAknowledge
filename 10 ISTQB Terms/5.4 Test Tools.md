#  Test Tools

6.1. Tool Support for Testing
Examples:
- Test management tools – increase the test process efficiency by facilitating management of:
    - SDLC, 
    - requirements, 
    - tests, 
    - defects, 
    - configuration
- Static testing tools – support the tester in performing reviews and static analysis
- Test design and test implementation tools – facilitate generation of 
    - test cases, 
    - test data and 
    - test procedures
- Test execution and test coverage tools – facilitate automated test execution and coverage measurement
- Non-functional testing tools – allow the tester to perform non-functional testing
- DevOps tools – support 
    - DevOps delivery pipeline, 
    - workflow tracking, 
    - automated build process(es), 
    - CI/CD
- Collaboration tools – facilitate communication
- Tools supporting scalability and deployment standardization (e.g., 
    - virtual machines,
    - containerization tools)
- Any other tool that assists in testing (e.g., a spreadsheet is a test tool in the context of testing)

## Benefits and Risks of Test Automation

Simply acquiring a tool does not guarantee success. Each new tool will require effort to achieve real and lasting benefits (e.g., for 
    - tool introduction, 
    - maintenance and 
    - training). 

Potential **benefits** of using test automation include:
- Time saved by reducing repetitive manual work (e.g., 
    - execute regression tests, 
    - re-enter the same test data, 
    - compare expected results vs actual results, 
    - check against coding standards)
- Prevention of simple human errors through greater consistency and repeatability (e.g., 
    - tests are consistently derived from requirements, 
    - test data is created in a systematic manner, and 
    - tests are executed by a tool in the same order with the same frequency)
- More objective assessment (e.g., coverage) and providing measures that are too complicated for humans to determine
- Easier access to information about testing to support test management and test reporting (e.g., 
    - statistics, 
    - graphs, and 
    - aggregated data about test progress, 
    - failure rates, and 
    - test execution duration)
- Reduced test execution times to provide earlier defect detection, faster feedback and faster time to market
- More time for testers to design new, deeper and more effective tests

Potential **risks** of using test automation include:

- Unrealistic expectations about the benefits of a tool (including 
    - functionality and 
    - ease of use).
- Inaccurate estimations of 
    - time, 
    - costs, 
    - effort required to introduce a tool, 
    - maintain test scripts and 
    - change the existing manual test process.
- Using a test tool when manual testing is more appropriate.
- Relying on a tool too much, e.g., ignoring the need of human critical thinking.
- The dependency on the tool vendor which 
    - may go out of business, 
    - retire the tool, 
    - sell the tool to a different vendor or 
    - provide poor support (e.g., 
        - responses to queries, 
        - upgrades, and 
        - defect fixes).
- Using an open-source software which 
    - may be abandoned, meaning that no further updates are available, or 
    - its internal components may require quite frequent updates as a further development.
- The automation tool is not compatible with the development platform.
- Choosing an unsuitable tool that did not comply with the 
    - regulatory requirements and/or 
    - safety standards
