# What is Testing

Software systems are an integral part of our daily life.

`Work products = test objects`
- software testing must be aligned with the software development lifecycle.

Another common misconception about testing is that testing focuses entirely on verifying the test object.
While 
testing involves 
- verification, i.e., 
    - checking whether the system meets specified requirements,
    - involves validation, which means checking 
        - whether the system meets users’ and 
        - other stakeholders’ needs in its operational environment.

Testing may be 
- dynamic or 
    - uses different types of test techniques and 
    - test approaches to derive test cases
- static
    - includes reviews (see chapter 3) and 
    - static analysis

Testing needs to be properly 
- planned,
- managed, 
- estimated,
-monitored and controlled

### Test Objectives
The typical test objectives are:
- Evaluating work products such as:
    - requirements, 
        - Verifying whether all have been fulfilled
    - user stories, 
    - designs,  
    - code
- Causing failures and finding defects
- Ensuring required coverage of a test object
- Reducing the risk level of inadequate software quality
- Verifying that a test object complies with 
    - contractual, 
    - legal, and 
    - regulatory requirements
- Providing information to stakeholders
- Building confidence in the quality of the test object
- Validating whether the 
    - test object is complete and 
    - works as expected by the stakeholders

Test objectives can vary, depending upon the context, which includes: 
- work product being tested,
- test level, 
- risks, the 
- software development lifecycle (SDLC) being followed, and 
- factors related to the business context, e.g., 
    - corporate structure, 
    - competitive considerations, or 
    - time to market
