# Boundary Value Analysis

Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) is a test technique based on exercising the boundaries of equivalence
partitions. Therefore, BVA can only be used for ordered partitions. The minimum and maximum values of
a partition are its boundary values. In the case of BVA, if two elements belong to the same partition, all
elements between them must also belong to that partition.
BVA focuses on the boundary values of the partitions because developers are more likely to make errors
with these boundary values. Typical defects found by BVA are located where implemented boundaries
are misplaced to positions above or below their intended positions or are omitted altogether.
This syllabus covers two versions of the BVA: 2-value and 3-value BVA. They differ in terms of coverage
items per boundary that need to be exercised to achieve 100% coverage.

### In 2-value BVA, 
 ![2-value BVA](<images/2 BVA.png>)

for each boundary value there are two coverage items: 
- this boundary value and 
- its closest neighbor belonging to the adjacent partition. 

`100% coverage = test cases must exercise all coverage items` or `excercised / total`

### In 3-value BVA 
![3-value BVA ](<images/3 BVA.png>)

for each boundary value there are three coverage items:
- this boundary value and 
- both its neighbors and 
- may not be boundary values. 

`100% coverage = test cases must exercise all coverage items` or `excercised / total`

The password length is correct if it has between 6 and 12 characters inclusive.
| Equivalence Class | 2-value BVA | 3-value BVA |
|-----------------------------|-------|----------------------|
| Less than 6 characters      | 0, 5  | 0, **1**, **4**, 5   |
| 6–12 characters (inclusive) | 6, 12 | 6, **7**, **11**, 12 |
| More than 12 characters     | 13    | 13, **14**           |

Here are **ISTQB-style exam questions** focused on **Boundary Value Analysis (BVA)**.
They follow the **official ISTQB tone**, include **multiple-choice answers**, and I clearly mark the **correct answer with explanation**.

## **Question 1 – Identifying Boundary Values**

A system accepts a numeric input between **10 and 20 inclusive**.

Which of the following sets of test values represents **correct Boundary Value Analysis**?

    A. 10, 15, 20
    B. 9, 10, 20, 21
    C. 8, 9, 21, 22
    D. 11, 15, 19

✅ **Correct answer: B**

**Explanation:**
BVA focuses on values **at the boundaries and just outside** them.

* Lower boundary: 10 → **9**
* Upper boundary: 20 → **21**

## **Question 2 – 2-Value vs 3-Value BVA**

A field allows values from **1 to 100 inclusive**.

Which of the following test sets represents **3-value Boundary Value Analysis**?

    A. 1, 100
    B. 0, 1, 100, 101
    C. 1, 2, 99, 100
    D. 0, 1, 2, 99, 100, 101

✅ **Correct answer: D**

**Explanation:**
3-value BVA tests:

* boundary −1
* boundary
* boundary +1

So:

* Lower: 0, 1, 2
* Upper: 99, 100, 101

## **Question 3 – Choosing the Best BVA Test Cases**

A password length must be **between 8 and 16 characters inclusive**.

Which test cases best apply **Boundary Value Analysis**?

    A. 8, 12, 16
    B. 7, 8, 16, 17
    C. 6, 7, 8, 16, 17, 18
    D. 9, 10, 11

✅ **Correct answer: B**

**Explanation:**
BVA tests:

* Just below lower boundary (7)
* At lower boundary (8)
* At upper boundary (16)
* Just above upper boundary (17)

---

## **Question 4 – Understanding the Purpose of BVA**

Which statement **best describes Boundary Value Analysis**?

    A. A technique used to test all possible input combinations
    B. A technique focusing on random values within equivalence classes
    C. A technique focusing on values at the edges of equivalence classes
    D. A technique used only for performance testing

✅ **Correct answer: C**

**Explanation:**
BVA is based on the observation that **defects frequently occur at boundaries**.

## **Question 5 – Applying BVA to Dates**

A system allows booking dates from **1 January to 31 December** of the same year.

Which test set best represents **Boundary Value Analysis**?

    A. 1 Jan, 15 Jun, 31 Dec
    B. 31 Dec (previous year), 1 Jan, 31 Dec, 1 Jan (next year)
    C. 15 Jun only
    D. All dates in the year

✅ **Correct answer: B**

**Explanation:**
BVA includes:

* Just before the lower boundary
* At the lower boundary
* At the upper boundary
* Just after the upper boundary

---

## **Question 6 – Common BVA Mistake**

Which of the following is a **common mistake** when applying Boundary Value Analysis?

    A. Testing values inside the valid range
    B. Testing only boundary values and not values just outside
    C. Using BVA for numeric input fields
    D. Combining BVA with equivalence partitioning

✅ **Correct answer: B**

**Explanation:**
BVA must test **both valid and invalid boundary values**.

### 📌 Exam Tip (ISTQB)

If a question mentions:

* **“edges”**, **“limits”**, **“just below / above”** → think **BVA**
* **ranges** → combine **Equivalence Partitioning + BVA**

If you want, I can:

* Create **mock ISTQB exams**
* Provide **trick questions**
* Show **why wrong answers look tempting**
* Map questions to **ISTQB syllabus levels (Foundation / Advanced)**
