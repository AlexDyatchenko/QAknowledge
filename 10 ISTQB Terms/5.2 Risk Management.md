# Risk Management

The main **risk management activities** are:
- Risk analysis
    - risk identification
    - risk assessment
- Risk control
    - risk mitigation
    - risk monitoring

**Risk-based testing** is the test approach, in which **test activities** are:
- selected, 
- prioritized and
- managed based on 
    - risk analysis and 
    - risk control.

## Risk definition and risk attributes
- Risk likelihood (probability of risk occurence) `0 > risk < 1`
- Risk impact (harm) the consiquences of this occurence
These two factors express the `Risk Level = Risk Likelihood × Risk Impact` which is the measure of the risk.

Example scale

| Factor     | Values                        |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- |
| Likelihood | 1 (Low) – 5 (Very High)       |
| Impact     | 1 (Negligible) – 5 (Critical) |

**Risk Matrix**

| Impact ↓ / Likelihood → | 1 | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
| ----------------------- | - | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| **5 Critical**          | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 |
| **4 High**              | 4 | 8  | 12 | 16 | 20 |
| **3 Medium**            | 3 | 6  | 9  | 12 | 15 |
| **2 Low**               | 2 | 4  | 6  | 8  | 10 |
| **1 Negligible**        | 1 | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |

Typical thresholds:

* **High risk**: 15–25 → must be mitigated `>60%`
* **Medium risk**: 6–14 → monitor / partially mitigate `25-60%`
* **Low risk**: 1–5 → accept `0-25%`

---

**Extended formula (less common, more formal)**

In safety-critical or financial domains, risk can be extended:

**Risk Level = Likelihood × Impact × Exposure**

Where:

* **Exposure** = how often the system is used or how many users are affected

Example:

* Likelihood = 0.1
* Impact = 9
* Exposure = 1000 users

Risk = 900

This helps prioritize risks affecting many users even if probability is low.

## 4. How this is applied in testing (important for you)

In **risk-based testing**, risk level is used to:

* Decide **what to test first**
* Allocate **more tests to high-risk areas**
* Decide **depth of testing**

Typical mapping:

* **High risk** → automated + exploratory + negative tests
* **Medium risk** → functional + some edge cases
* **Low risk** → smoke or minimal coverage

# Project Risks and Product Risks

In software testing one is generally concerned with two types of risks: project risks and product risks. 

**Project risks** are related to the management and control of the project.
- **Organizational issues** (e.g., delays in work products deliveries, inaccurate estimates, cost cutting)
- **People issues** (e.g., insufficient skills, conflicts, communication problems, shortage of staff)
- **Technical issues** (e.g., scope creep, poor tool support)
- **Supplier issues** (e.g., third-party delivery failure, bankruptcy of the supporting company)

Project risks, when they occur, may have an impact on the project 
- 📅schedule, 
- 💰budget or 
- scope creep, which affects the project's ability to achieve its objectives.
- Poor tool support

**Product risks** examples include: 
- missing or wrong functionality, 
- incorrect calculations, 
- runtime errors, poor architecture, 
- inefficient algorithms, 
- inadequate response time, 
- poor user experience, 
- security vulnerabilities. 

Product risks, when they occur, may result in various negative consequences, including:
- User dissatisfaction
- Loss of revenue, trust, reputation
- Damage to third parties
- High maintenance costs, overload of the help desk
- Criminal penalties
- In extreme cases, physical damage, injuries or even death

### Product Risk Analysis
- begins early in the SDLC
- consists of 
    - risk identification and 
    - risk assessment

Stakeholders can identify risks by using various techniques and tools, e.g., 
- brainstorming, 
- workshops, 
- interviews, or 
- cause-effect diagrams. 

Risk assessment involves:
- categorization of identified risks, 
- determining their risk likelihood, 
- risk impact and 
- risk level, prioritizing, and proposing ways to handle them. 

Risk assessment can use a
- quantitative or 
    - `Risk impact = Risk level      / Risk likelihood`
    - `Risk level  = risk likelihood * risk impact`
- qualitative approach `determined using a risk matrix`, or a mix of them. 

**Product risk analysis** may influence the 
- thoroughness and 
- test scope. 

Its results are used to:
- Determine the test scope to be carried out
- Determine the particular test levels and propose test types to be performed
- Determine the test techniques to be employed and the coverage to be achieved
- Estimate the test effort required for each task
- Prioritize testing in an attempt to find the critical defects as early as possible
- Determine whether any activities in addition to testing could be employed to reduce risk

### Product Risk Control

Consists of 
- risk mitigation and 
    - involves implementing the actions proposed in risk assessment to reduce the risk level
- risk monitoring. 
    - The aim is to ensure that the mitigation actions are effective, to obtain further information to
        - improve risk assessment, and to 
        - identify emerging risks.

Response options to product risk: 
- risk mitigation by testing, Actions that can be taken:
    - Select the testers with the right level of experience and skills, suitable for a given risk type
    - Apply an appropriate level of independence of testing
    - Perform reviews and static analysis
    - Apply the appropriate test techniques and coverage levels
    - Apply the appropriate test types addressing the affected quality characteristics
    - Perform dynamic testing, including regression testing
- risk acceptance, 
- risk transfer, or a 
- contingency plan.
