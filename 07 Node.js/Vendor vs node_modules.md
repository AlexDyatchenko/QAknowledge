Good insight! They're **conceptually the same idea** but with important practical differences.

**Conceptually**: Both `vendor` and `node_modules` serve the same purpose—storing third-party dependencies that your project depends on.

**Practically, they differ**:

**`vendor` folder (PHP, Ruby, etc.)**:
- Stores external packages/libraries
- Manually committed to version control (sometimes)
- Flat or nested structure depending on the package manager
- Generally smaller and more manageable

**`node_modules` folder (Node.js)**:
- Stores external packages AND their nested dependencies (recursive tree)
- **Never committed** to version control (listed in `.gitignore`)
- Massive in size (often 500MB+)
- Recreated fresh with `npm install` from `package-lock.json`
- Contains a complex dependency tree with nested `node_modules` folders inside packages

**Key structural difference**:

PHP's `vendor/`:
```
vendor/
├── symfony/
│   └── console/
├── monolog/
│   └── monolog/
```

Node's `node_modules/`:
```
node_modules/
├── react/
│   ├── node_modules/          ← nested!
│   │   └── object-assign/
├── webpack/
│   ├── node_modules/          ← nested!
│   │   ├── lodash/
│   │   └── chalk/
```

**So the answer**: They're the **same conceptual idea** (dependencies storage) but `node_modules` is much larger and has a unique recursive structure because Node packages can have their own dependencies.

In that sense, `vendor` is simpler/flatter while `node_modules` is more complex due to how npm dependency resolution works. But yes, you can think of them as serving the same fundamental role in their respective ecosystems.
