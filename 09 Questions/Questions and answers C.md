Q: Which of the following is a typical test objective?
- A: Causing failures and identifying defects

Q: Which of the following statements BEST describes the difference between testing and debugging?
- A: Testing determines that defects exist while debugging removes defects

Q: The ‘absence-of-defects fallacy’ is one of the principles of testing. Which of the following is an example of addressing this principle in practice?
- A: Supporting the end users to perform acceptance testing

Q: Which of the following test activities are MOST likely to involve the application of boundary value analysis and equivalence partitioning?
- A: Test analysis and 
- A: test design

Q: Testware produces activities:
- A: Test execution schedule -> Test implementation
- A: Test design -> Coverage items
- A: Test analysis -> Prioritized test conditions
- A: Test completion -> Change requests

Q: Which of the following is an advantage of the whole-team approach?
- A: Improved team dynamics

Q: Which of the following is a good testing practice that applies to all software development lifecycles?
- A: For every development activity, there is a corresponding test activity

Q: Which of the following is an example of a test-first approach to development?
- A: Acceptance Test-Driven Development

Q: Which of the following is a benefit of early and frequent stakeholder feedback?
- A: Changes to requirements are understood and implemented earlier

Q: Which of the following is a factor that contributes to a successful review?
- A: Split large work products into smaller parts

Q: How can white-box testing be useful in support of black-box testing?
- A: White-box coverage measures can help testers evaluate black-box tests in terms of the code coverage achieved by these black-box tests
- E: Performing only black-box testing does not provide a measure of actual code coverage. White-box coverage measures provide an objective measurement of coverage and provide the necessary information to allow additional tests to be generated to increase this coverage, and subsequently increase confidence in the code.

Q: You are preparing a test execution schedule for executing seven test cases TC 1 to TC 7.
The following figure includes the priorities of these test cases (1=highest priority, 3 = lowest priority).
- A: You need to rush to run 1 priority (1) even if you need to run lover (3) priority test cases first, skipping middle priority test cases (2).
- E: The ISTQB approach prioritizes getting to priority 1 test cases as early as possible.

Q: What does the test pyramid model show?
- A: That tests may have different granularity
- A: Unit tests = fine/high granularity (most detailed, smallest scope)
- A: Integration tests = medium granularity (middle scope)
- A: End-to-end tests = coarse/low granularity (least detailed, largest scope)

Q: Which of the following is a typical purpose of test metrics?
- A: To show progress against the planned test schedule and budget

Q: What is the relationship between the testing quadrants, test levels and test types?
- A: Testing quadrants group test levels and test types by several criteria such as targeting specific stakeholders

Q: The Relationship Between Test Levels and Testing Pyramid
- A: Yes, there is a correspondence, but they are NOT the same thing.<br>
```
    Testing Pyramid         →    Test Levels
    ─────────────────────────────────────────
    Unit Tests              →    Unit Testing
    Integration Tests       →    Integration Testing
    End-to-End/UI Tests     →    System Testing + Acceptance Testing
```

Q: Which of the following is an example of how product risk analysis may influence the thoroughness and scope of testing?
- A: The assessed risk level helps us to select the rigor of testing

Q: Which of the following activities in the test process makes the MOST use of test progress reports?
- A: Test completion

Q: What is the MOST important information that is missing from this defect report?
- A: Test management tools
