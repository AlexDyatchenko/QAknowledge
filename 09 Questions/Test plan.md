The typical content of a test plan includes:
- Context of testing (e.g., test scope, test objectives, test basis)
- Assumptions and constraints of the test project
- Stakeholders (e.g., roles, responsibilities, relevance to testing, hiring and training needs)
- Communication (e.g., forms and frequency of communication, documentation templates)
- Risk register (e.g., product risks, project risks)
- Test approach (e.g., 
    - test levels, 
    - test types, 
    - test techniques, 
    - test deliverables, 
    - entry criteria and
    - exit criteria, 
    - independence of testing, 
    - metrics to be collected, 
    - test data requirements, 
    - test environment requirements, 
    - deviations from the test policy and 
    - test strategy)
- Budget and schedule

In iterative SDLCs, typically two kinds of planning occur: 
- **release planning** and 
- **iteration planning**
