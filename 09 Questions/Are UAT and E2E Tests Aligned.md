### Are UAT and E2E Tests Aligned?

Yes, they are aligned in purpose but differ in scope and execution.

**Alignment:**
- Both aim to validate that the system works as expected from the user's perspective.
- Both test the entire flow of a business process, involving multiple systems, components, or services.
- Both are real-world oriented and often involve real data and user interactions.

**Differences:**
- E2E testing is technical and performed by QA engineers or automation teams.
- UAT is business-focused and performed by end users or business stakeholders."
