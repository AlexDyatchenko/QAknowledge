A **PRD (Product Requirements Document)** is a formal document used in product development that **defines what a product (or feature) should do, why it’s being built, and who it’s for**. It’s essentially a blueprint that aligns everyone on the product vision, key features, goals, and expected behaviour before building begins. ([Atlassian][1])

### 📌 What a PRD Typically Covers

A good PRD usually includes some (or all) of the following:
✅ **Product overview & goals** – Why this product or feature exists. ([Atlassian][1])
✅ **Target users/personas** – Who it’s for and what problems it solves. ([Figma][2])
✅ **Core features & requirements** – What the product must do (often in user story format). ([Atlassian][1])
✅ **Functional specs** – High-level info about behaviour and interactions. ([Lesley Banser][3])
✅ **Success metrics/KPIs** – How you’ll measure if it’s successful. ([airfocus][4])
✅ **Constraints, assumptions & out-of-scope** – Items you’re *not* building now. ([Atlassian][1])

> It focuses on the **“what” and “why”** rather than the exact technical implementation, so designers and engineers have clarity without prescribing *how* to build it. ([ProductPlan][5])

### 📄 Why You Use a PRD

A PRD serves to:
• Align **product managers**, **developers**, **designers**, and **stakeholders** on goals and scope. ([Atlassian][1])
• Reduce miscommunication or scope creep later in development. ([Atlassian][1])
• Act as a **single source of truth** throughout the product lifecycle. ([ProductPlan][5])
