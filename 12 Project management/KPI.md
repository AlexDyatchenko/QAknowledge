### KPI stands for Key Performance Indicator.

It’s a measurable value that shows how effectively an individual, team, or organization is achieving key objectives.

Simple examples:

Business: 
- Revenue growth, 
- customer retention rate

QA / Testing: 
- Test coverage %, 
- defect leakage, 
- automation pass rate

IT / DevOps: 
- Deployment frequency, 
- mean time to recovery (MTTR)

In short:
👉 KPIs help track whether you’re moving toward your goals or not.
